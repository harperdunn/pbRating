        <p class="lead">
            UPGRADE Dining is a nationwide grassroots campaign, spearheaded by Food 4 Thought Innovations, 
            to encourage universities to shift towards more plant-based food options.
        </p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is simple. Get universities to replace 50 percent of their animal-based options with 
            plant-based options by 2030. Our approach is customized to each university. We recognize that 
            each university operates with its own interests and constraints. By aligning with the priorities 
            of the university, we make a compelling case for why shifting to plant-based options is in their 
            best interests, including saving on costs, increasing student satisfaction, reducing social and 
            environmental harm, and expanding culinary innovation.
        </p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Theory of Change</h2>
        <p>
            As students and paying customers at these universities, we are uniquely positioned to provide the 
            demand-side push that is needed to bring more plant-based options to universities. By launching a 
            strategically-coordinated public pressure campaign, we can kickstart a conversation at US 
            universities that hasn’t been had before (at scale).  With the backing of large coalitions of 
            students and organizations, we aim to set customized implementation plans that involve working 
            with our partners to add alt proteins into daily menus, create cost-effective default 
            interventions, and undergo necessary training to facilitate a plant-based transition.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ve partnered with nearly 30 plant-based and alternative protein companies to organize tasting 
            events at universities and offer discounted packages for adding products. The data we gather will 
            be useful for our implementation partners when engaging in conversations with food service 
            providers, since it will likely show that there is widespread favorability towards these products 
            among a diverse array of students.
        </p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Our campaign is targeted at ten campuses that we have assessed as ideal fits based on a number of 
            factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High potential for impact</li>
            <li>Dining team receptiveness to plant-based foods</li>
            <li>Student favorability of plant-based foods</li>
            <li>Schools which are independent food service operators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These schools include Harvard University, Stanford University, California Institute of Technology, 
            Cornell University, UCLA, Rice University, Tufts University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University, 
            and the University of Michigan. By the end of 2025, we hope to accomplish the following goals:
